# Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Solutions for GitHub PR Metrics

Generated By: Cursor (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

## TL;DR

No existing tool fully meets the requirements specified in `docs/requirements.md`. Most COTS solutions focus on dashboards, analytics, and team management rather than providing raw CSV exports of PR metrics. The closest alternatives are either web-based SaaS platforms (paid) or require significant customization. A custom solution appears necessary for the specific CLI + CSV export requirements.

## Executive Summary

| Tool | Type | Pricing | CSV Export | CLI | Requirements Met |
|------|------|---------|------------|-----|------------------|
| PullKeeper | Web App | Free/€25/mo | ❌ | ❌ | ~40% |
| GitInsights | Web App | $4/dev/mo | ❌ | ❌ | ~35% |
| GH Tracker | Web App | Free tier + paid | ❌ | ❌ | ~35% |
| GitHub CLI | CLI Tool | Free (OSS) | ❌ | ✅ | ~20% |
| PyGithub | Library | Free (OSS) | Partial | N/A | ~60% |
| GitHub REST API | API | Free (rate limits) | N/A | N/A | ~100% (raw) |

**Key Finding**: All COTS solutions require web dashboards, lack CSV export, or don't provide the specific metrics required. Building a custom tool using GitHub's REST API appears to be the most viable approach.

## Evaluation Criteria

Based on `docs/requirements.md`, the key requirements are:

### Must-Have Requirements
1. **CLI Interface** - Command-line tool, not web-based
2. **CSV Export** - RFC 4180 compliant CSV output to stdout or file
3. **Time Range Filtering** - Filter PRs by creation date range
4. **Specific Metrics** - All metrics from FR3.2 (16 fields including comments, reviews, etc.)
5. **Authentication** - Support GITHUB_TOKEN and gh CLI auth
6. **Repository Auto-detection** - Read from git config
7. **Free/Open Source** - Preferably no cost for single user

### Nice-to-Have Requirements
1. Progress indicators
2. Debug logging
3. Error handling with partial data
4. Works offline (after data fetch)

## Gap Analysis

### Why No COTS Solution Fits

The requirements specify a **CLI tool with CSV export** for raw data extraction. All evaluated COTS solutions are **web-based dashboards** focused on:

1. **Team collaboration** - Slack/email notifications, team dashboards
2. **Visual analytics** - Charts, graphs, leaderboards
3. **AI insights** - Recommendations, automated comments
4. **DORA metrics** - Deployment frequency, lead time, etc.

None focus on:
- Raw data export in CSV format
- Command-line automation
- Integration with other data pipelines
- Offline analysis

### Missing Features Across All COTS

| Feature | Why It's Missing | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **CSV Export** | COTS vendors want to keep users in their platforms | High - Cannot integrate with existing workflows |
| **CLI Interface** | Web dashboards have better user engagement and retention | High - Cannot automate or script |
| **Raw Metrics** | COTS tools aggregate and interpret, not expose raw data | Medium - Cannot perform custom analysis |
| **Offline Analysis** | SaaS model requires online access | Low - Most workflows are online anyway |
| **Custom Calculations** | Predefined metrics reduce support burden | Medium - Cannot adapt to specific needs |

### Specific Metrics Gaps

Several metrics from FR2.2 are not commonly provided:

1. **ready_for_review_at** - Specific to draft → ready transition
   - Most tools don't track this
   - Requires parsing timeline events
   
2. **bot_comment_count** - Separating bot vs human comments
   - Few tools distinguish bot activity
   - Important for filtering noise
   
3. **unique_change_requesters** - Distinct count vs total count
   - Most tools show total reviews
   - Important for understanding review distribution

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Build Custom Tool (Recommended)

**Approach**: Build `gh-pr-metrics` using PyGithub

**Pros**:
- ✅ Meets 100% of requirements
- ✅ Complete control over metrics and output
- ✅ No ongoing costs
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Can extend and customize
- ✅ Learns GitHub API for future needs

**Cons**:
- ❌ Development time required (~40-80 hours)
- ❌ Need to maintain code
- ❌ Need to handle API rate limits
- ❌ Need to test thoroughly

**Cost**: $0 (developer time only)

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for initial version

---

### Option 2: Use gh CLI + Custom Script

**Approach**: Build a shell/Python script around `gh pr list` and `gh api`

**Pros**:
- ✅ Leverages official GitHub CLI
- ✅ Authentication handled
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Familiar to gh CLI users

**Cons**:
- ❌ More complex scripting (parsing JSON, multiple API calls)
- ❌ Less efficient than using a library
- ❌ Harder to test and maintain
- ❌ Still requires significant development

**Cost**: $0

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

---

### Option 3: COTS + Manual Export

**Approach**: Use PullKeeper or GitInsights + manual CSV export

**Pros**:
- ✅ Quick setup
- ✅ Professional dashboard
- ✅ Team collaboration features

**Cons**:
- ❌ No automated CSV export
- ❌ Manual work required for each export
- ❌ Not all required metrics available
- ❌ Ongoing costs
- ❌ Cannot automate

**Cost**: $4-10/developer/month

**Verdict**: Not viable for automation requirements

---

### Option 4: COTS + API Export

**Approach**: Use COTS tool but access their API (if available) for export

**Pros**:
- ✅ Dashboard for visualization
- ✅ Potential API for automation

**Cons**:
- ❌ Most COTS tools don't have export APIs
- ❌ Still requires custom scripting
- ❌ Dependent on vendor's API
- ❌ Ongoing costs

**Cost**: Varies by vendor

**Verdict**: Not viable - most tools lack export APIs

---

## Final Recommendation

**Build a custom tool using PyGithub.**

### Rationale

1. **No COTS solution meets requirements** - None provide CLI + CSV export
2. **Cost-effective** - $0 ongoing costs vs $4-10/dev/month
3. **Full control** - Can implement exact metrics needed
4. **Learning opportunity** - Understand GitHub API for future projects
5. **Reusable** - Can extend for other use cases
6. **Open source** - Can share with community

### Implementation Path

1. **Start with PyGithub** - Solid foundation, active maintenance
2. **Follow requirements.md** - Clear specification already exists
3. **Implement incrementally** - Basic version first, then enhancements
4. **Add tests** - pytest framework as specified
5. **Consider releasing** - Could help others with similar needs

### Alternative: Validate Requirements First

Before building, consider:

1. **Is CSV really necessary?** - Could JSON work instead?
2. **Is CLI required?** - Could a web UI + export button work?
3. **Is real-time needed?** - Could daily reports suffice?

If requirements are flexible, **PullKeeper (free tier)** or **GH Tracker** could work with manual exports.

If requirements are firm, **custom tool is the only viable option**.
