# AI bot detection configuration
# Distinguishes AI-powered bots from traditional automation bots
ai_bots:
  # Always classified as AI - simple name matching with regex
  # These bots are ALWAYS counted as AI regardless of comment content
  always:
    - "cursor\\[bot\\]"               # Cursor AI assistant
    - "claude\\[bot\\]"               # Claude AI assistant
    - "Copilot"                       # GitHub Copilot
    - "copilot-pull-request-reviewer\\[bot\\]"  # Copilot PR reviewer
  
  # Conditionally classified as AI - requires content pattern matching
  # Used for generic automation that sometimes runs AI-powered reviews
  # The bot is only counted as AI if comment/review content matches patterns
  conditional:
    - name: "github-actions\\[bot\\]"  # Regex pattern for bot name
      # Regex patterns to search for in comment/review body
      content_patterns:
        - "Code Review Summary"        # AI-generated review summaries
        - "Code Review from AI bot"    # Explicit AI review indicator
        - "Files Reviewed"             # AI file review reports
      # match_any: true  = any pattern match counts as AI (OR logic)
      # match_any: false = all patterns required to count as AI (AND logic)
      match_any: true

# Number of parallel workers for PR processing

#   - "{owner}_{repo}_metrics.csv"     # ansible_awx_metrics.csv
# Can be overridden with --output CLI argument
# Default: null (stdout)
